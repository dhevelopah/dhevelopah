- âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was literally a bug.
      Back in 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found a moth trapped in a relay, causing an error. They taped the insect into their logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." That's where the term "computer bug" comes from!
